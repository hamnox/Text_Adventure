# Text_Adventure

An abandoned exploration of how deep the Python Classes hole goes.

I had an idea that I could make a text-adventure game, and then had an idea that I could encapsulate important building functions, and then had an idea that I could make a generic text-adventure-from-specification program.

Scope creep at its finest, folks.
